# ADARcas

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `ADARcas` is to provide some functions that allow the user to 
measure ADARs activity by using previously developed signatures, or by computing 
his own signature starting if a dataset with its reconstructed regulatory 
network is available. ADARs' activity will be represented by a Contextual
Activity Score (CAS), that is specific for human neuronal, mouse neuronal or
cancert contexts and can be computed starting from bulk, single-cell RNA-Seq or
spatial transcriptomic data.

## Installation instructions

Get the latest stable `R` release from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `ADARcas` from [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) using the following code:

```{r 'install', eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("ADARcas")
```

## Citation

Below is the citation output from using `citation('ADARcas')` in R. Please
run this yourself to check for any updates on how to cite __ADARcas__.

```{r 'citation', eval = requireNamespace('ADARcas')}
#print(citation('ADARcas'), bibtex = TRUE)
```

Please note that the `ADARcas` was only made possible thanks to many other R and bioinformatics software authors, which are cited either in the vignettes and/or the paper(s) describing this package.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that the `ADARcas` project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](http://bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/). By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

## Development tools

* Continuous code testing is possible thanks to [GitHub actions](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/usethis-1-6-0/)  through `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('usethis')`, `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('remotes')`, and `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('rcmdcheck')` customized to use [Bioconductor's docker containers](https://www.bioconductor.org/help/docker/) and `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('BiocCheck')`.
* Code coverage assessment is possible thanks to [codecov](https://codecov.io/gh) and `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('covr')`.
* The code is styled automatically thanks to `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('styler')`.
* The documentation is formatted thanks to `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('devtools')` and `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('roxygen2')`.

For more details, check the `dev` directory.

This package was developed using `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('biocthis')`.
