Description: The functions of the package allow to measure ADARsâ€™ activity 
 scores starting from an expression matrix of bulk, single-cell or spatial
 transcriptomics datasets, based on the previously computed signatures from 
 different biological contexts. The package also allows to get the protein 
 activity scores by computing a signature starting from the dataset given in 
 input with its reconstructed regulatory network.
